# Hi 👋, I'm Antonio!

As an experienced software engineer, I am passionate about working with cutting-edge technologies and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. Currently, my focus is on web3, distributed, and decentralized systems, where I am constantly exploring new approaches and techniques to build the next generation of decentralized applications.

In addition to my work in web3, I also have a background in Big Data and data processing, where I have built and managed complex systems for processing and analyzing large datasets. With a deep understanding of data pipelines, distributed computing, and scalable architecture, I am confident designing and implementing robust data processing solutions.

I am always looking for new challenges to tackle and exciting opportunities to grow my skills.

Outside of work, I am always learning and have a variety of hobbies. Currently, I am exploring synth music generation and built my own e-bike. I also enjoy sports, having played Rolled Hockey competitively. I am an outdoor enthusiast and love to hike, exploring every corner of Granada’s beautiful landscapes.
